- example usage -tmdb tv better call saul or -tmdb movie star wars: revenge of the sith. You can also (optionally) include the year as a way to specify which result you would like, if there are multiple of the same name. Year goes after the title (-tmdb tv avatar the last airbender 2005)
- watch: Provides a list of where you can LEGALLY watch a show / movie, according go JustWatch.com's database.
- Unlike for tmdb, you must include the year and region. Format is like this: -watch tv/movie [title], [year], [region acronym]. Do not actually include the brackets when using the command

- example usage: -randcapy
- randanimal: randomly picks one of the possible results from the previous command, and posts a picture of that animal
